# Fetch and Render Calisthenics

A small exercise in minimalism and fetching / rendering items from two APIs.

There are two mini apps contained in this repo, one written in vanilla JavaScript (plainJSVersion.html), the other in ReactJS + hooks (App.js).

Commonalities include:

* both apps written as either one JS file or all in App.js (as per requirements of challenge)

* rendering 20 data points from [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/) and [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

* all data points styled in desktop-only two-column format

* all CSS written in [BEM](http://getbem.com/) format

* fetch requests constructed using a minimal, customized REST client


## Setup: React Version
1. `npm install` all the things.

2. `npm start` to run.

## Setup: Plain JavaScript Version
1. Open the `src/plainJSVersion.html` file using your web browser of choice. That's it.

## (Unused) Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`
### `yarn test`
### `yarn build`
### `yarn eject`
